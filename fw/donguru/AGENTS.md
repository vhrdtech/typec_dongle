# AGENTS.md — donguru

This firmware (STM32G0B1CE, `embassy`) was generated from the **embedded_bedrock firmware template**
(`firmware_template_skill/` in https://github.com/romixlab/embedded_bedrock, the `firmware-template` agent skill, generator
`scripts/bedrock_gen.py`). After generation it is an ordinary Rust project and is meant to be edited freely.

## Layout: WireWeaver API crate + firmware

The firmware serves a [WireWeaver](https://github.com/vhrdtech/wire_weaver) API over USB. Unlike the template's
WireWeaver layout (`<api>/` + `firmware/` side by side), this repo keeps:

- `../../donguru_api/` (repo root) — `#![no_std]` API crate: the `DonguruApi` trait (`#[ww_api_root]`) and its data
  types (`#[derive_shrink_wrap]`). A member of the repo-root Cargo workspace (host tools use it with `std`). Its name +
  version identify the API on the wire: bump the version with every change and follow WireWeaver's
  `docs/evolution/rules.md` so deployed devices and hosts keep working together.
- `fw/donguru/` (this directory) — the firmware, a standalone crate; `src/ww.rs` implements the API on `ServerState`
  (`ww_codegen!`) and runs the USB server. The USB driver is created in `src/main.rs` and handed to `ww::start`.

WireWeaver crates come from the local checkout next to this repo (`~/git/wire_weaver`, relative path deps).
Its `AGENTS.md` and `docs/` explain the API DSL (methods, properties, streams) and the wire format.

The trait, `ServerState` and the method implementations were blinky stubs; they are this firmware's own code now.
On template upgrades take only plumbing changes there (dependencies, transport set-up, `ww_codegen!` arguments),
never the stubs.

`bedrock_fw.json` (project root, keep it under version control) records:

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `template` | repo, sub-directory, **git commit** and CHANGELOG version of the template this firmware was last generated / upgraded from |
| `answers` | every generator option (chip, framework, logging, bootloader, counters, ...) — regenerating with them reproduces the project |
| `command` | the same answers as a `bedrock_gen.py new ...` command line (informational) |
| `upgrades` | history of applied template upgrades |
| `rejected` | template changes the user declined; **do not propose them again** unless upstream changed them further |
| `nuances` | firmware-specific facts that matter for upgrades (e.g. "clock tree hand-written, never take main.rs clock init") |

Do not edit `template` by hand except as part of an upgrade (below). Keep `answers` in sync if you change something
the generator decides (e.g. switch logging, add the bootloader) so later upgrades regenerate the right thing.

## Updating from the template

The firmware can later pick up template improvements (crate bumps, bug fixes, new features). When the user asks for
a template update/upgrade, **first produce a report, change nothing** until the user approves.

1. **Get the template.** Clone it into a temp dir, `git clone https://github.com/romixlab/embedded_bedrock "$TMP/tpl"` (or use a local
   checkout / the installed `firmware-template` skill if the user points to one; do not modify that checkout).
   Target revision: latest `main` unless the user names one. `S="$TMP/tpl/<template.path>/scripts/bedrock_gen.py"`;
   run it with `uv run "$S" ...`.
2. **What changed.** `OLD=<template.commit>`:
   `git -C "$TMP/tpl" log --reverse --format='%h %ad %s%n%b' --date=short $OLD..HEAD -- <template.path>` and the entries
   of `<template.path>/CHANGELOG.md` newer than `template.version` — read their *Upgrade notes*. Use
   `git -C "$TMP/tpl" diff $OLD HEAD -- <template.path>/scripts` for details. If `OLD` is null/unknown, skip the base
   (step 4) and rely on the changelog.
3. **New options.** `uv run "$S" check-answers bedrock_fw.json` lists options that did not exist when this firmware
   was generated (and removed ones). Ask the user about each `NEW` option (explain it, suggest the default) and about
   any changelog entry that changes a default or behaviour the firmware relies on. Record the answers.
4. **Regenerate** into temp dirs with the same answers (`--answers` reuses them, explicit flags override / add new
   options):
   - new: `uv run "$S" new --answers bedrock_fw.json [--new-option ...] --out "$TMP/new"`
   - base (optional but strongly recommended, shows what the template changed vs what the firmware changed):
     `git -C "$TMP/tpl" worktree add --detach "$TMP/old" $OLD` then
     `uv run "$TMP/old/<template.path>/scripts/bedrock_gen.py" new --answers bedrock_fw.json --out "$TMP/base"`
5. **Fuzzy compare.** `uv run "$S" compare --current . --new "$TMP/new" [--base "$TMP/base"] [--diff]` classifies
   files (whitespace-insensitive): `take-new` (template changed, file untouched locally), `merge` (both changed),
   `added-upstream`, `removed-upstream`, `deleted-locally`, `up-to-date`. Then read the diffs yourself: the firmware
   was edited by humans, so match template changes to the corresponding code by meaning (renamed functions, moved
   blocks, reformatted `Cargo.toml`), not by line. Ignore noise that is not an upgrade: generated nightly date,
   `bedrock_fw.json`, `Cargo.lock`, stm32-data differences unrelated to the change.
6. **Report** to the user, grouped per logical upgrade (not per file), each with: id/short title, source (commits,
   changelog entry), what it changes in *this* firmware, files, risk / manual work (merge conflicts, API changes,
   needs hardware test), recommendation. List separately: changes skipped because they are in `rejected` (only
   mention them if upstream changed them again), changes that do not apply, new options and what was answered.
   Ask which upgrades to apply.
7. **Apply only the approved upgrades**, preserving local modifications; merge by hand where needed. Then
   `cargo build` (and `cd bootloader && cargo build` if present) — fix until it builds; mention anything that needs
   testing on hardware.
8. **Update `bedrock_fw.json`**: set `template` to the new commit/version/date (copy it from
   `$TMP/new/bedrock_fw.json`), update `answers` (new options, changed answers) and `command` likewise, append to
   `upgrades` `{"date", "from", "to", "applied": [...], "notes"}`, add declined items to `rejected`
   `{"id", "title", "commit"/"version", "files", "reason", "date"}`, and add anything learned about this firmware to
   `nuances`. Even when everything was rejected, record the new commit so the next upgrade starts from it.
9. Remove the temp dirs / worktree (`git -C "$TMP/tpl" worktree remove "$TMP/old"`).

If only some upgrades were applied, the firmware is still recorded at the new commit; the rejected list is what keeps
the skipped changes from being proposed again.
